## Welcome to the PDFDownloader!

Please make sure the CSV file that you would like to read URLs from is placed inside \bin\Debug\net8.0
This CSV file must follow the format: id,pdf_url_1,pdf_url_2

Then go ahead and run the Program. 

You will be asked if you want to reset the Log. 
The Log will be automatically completely reset if it does not have data for every row in the CSV.
